Coin & Poison is a grid-based arcade game where players navigate a square character to collect coins while avoiding poison blocks.

**How It Works:**

Players move in four directions using arrow keys.
Collecting coins increases the score; colliding with poison ends the game.
The game ends when all coins are collected or the player hits a poison block.

**Features:**

Randomly spawned coins and poison blocks.
Real-time score tracking displayed on screen.
Simple yet engaging gameplay focused on reflexes and strategy.
